        <h3> HOW TO PLAY: </h3>
        
        <p>Guess the letter the computer is thinking of to prove you are psychic.</p>
        <p>Use the letters on your keyboard to guess.</p>
        <p>You are only allowed the pick letters (for your benefit).</p>
        <p>Once you pick a letter you are not allowed to guess it again (also for your benefit).</p>
        <p>You have 10 guesses to guess the correct letter.</p>
        <p>If you succeed, a win will be added to the tally.</p>
        <p>If you fail, a loss will be added to the tally.</p>
